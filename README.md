# An attempt at advent of code in my own esolang
~~Advent of code challenge done entirely in an esoteric programming language i wrote myself.~~

See [AdvancedEsolang](https://github.com/Ketok4321/AdvancedEsolang)

The advanced programming language, due to its design choices, is not capable of handling mathematical operations on numbers as big as this challenge requires.

I managed to solve the first 3 days with more or less hacks to get it working, but with day 4 the program wasn't able to run when given full input due to stack overflows.
